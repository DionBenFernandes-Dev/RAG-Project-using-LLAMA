What is Hacking? List and explain the stages of hacking.\\nHacking is the unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction\\nof computer systems, networks, or devices, often with the goal of stealing or manipulating\\ndata or disrupting services.\\n1. Reconnaissance\\n:\\nReconnaissance is the information-gathering stage of ethical hacking, where you collect data\\nabout the tar get system. This data can include anything from network infrastructure to\\nemployee contact details. The goal of reconnaissance is to identify as many potential attack\\nvectors as possible\\nThis is the first phase where the Hacker tries to collect information about the tar get. It may\\ninclude Identifying the Target, finding out the tar get’s IP Address Range, Network, DNS\\nrecords, etc.\\n2. Scanning\\n:\\nScanning can be considered a logical\\nextension (and overlap) of active\\nreconnaissance that helps attackers identify specific vulnerabilities.\\nIt's often that attackers use automated tools such as network scanners and war dialers to\\nlocate systems and attempt to discover vulnerabilities.\\nAn attacker follows a particular sequence of steps in order to scan a network. The scanning\\nmethods may dif fer based on the attack objectives, which are set up before the attackers\\nactually begin this process.\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Hackers are now probably seeking any\\ninformation that can help them perpetrate attacks such as computer names, IP  addresses, and\\nuser accounts.\\n3. Gaining Access:\\nIn this phase, the hacker designs the blueprint of the network of the tar get with the help of\\ndata collected during Phase 1 and Phase 2.\\nThe hacker has finished enumerating and scanning the network and now decides that they\\nhave some options to gain access to the network.\\n4. Maintaining Access:\\nOnce the hacker has gained\\naccess to the tar get system or\\nnetwork, they will try to maintain this access for as long as possible. This can involve\\ninstalling backdoors or other means\\no\\nf maintaining\\naccess even if the original vulnerability is\\ndiscovered and fixed.\\n5. Clearing Tracks\\n(so no one can reach them): Prior\\nto the attack, the attacker would\\nchange their MAC address and run the attacking machine through at least one VPN to help\\ncover their identity .  They will not deliver a direct attack or any scanning technique that\\nwould be deemed “noisy”. Once access is gained and privileges have been escalated, the\\nhacker seeks to cover their tracks.  This includes clearing out Sent emails, clearing server\\nlogs, temp files, etc.  The hacker will also look for indications of the email provider alerting\\nthe user or possible unauthorized logins under their account.\\n⚡\\n2. What do you mean by vulnerability assessment? What ar e its limitations?\\nAns:\\nVulnerability assessment is a process of identifying risks and vulnerabilities in computer\\nsystems, networks, hardware, applications, and other parts of the ecosystem. These \\nassessments are very important. They provide the required information about the \\nincident to security and response teams. This further helps them in analyzing and \\nprioritizing risks for potential remediation.\\nVulnerability assessments are a crucial part of IT  risk management lifecycles. It helps in\\nprotecting systems and data from unauthorized access and breaches. Security\\nprofessionals use vulnerability scanner tools to identify threats and flaws within the\\norganization’ s infrastructure that represents potential risks.\\nLimitations:\\nSoftwar e Program to Discover  Flaws\\nVulnerability scanning usually makes use of a software program that identifies\\nsecurity flaws, based upon a preset database of all the flaws currently known. The \\nscanner then tests the system by sending out remote threats to ensure that the system\\nis capable of saving itself against major security threats.\\nSometimes, the network administrators have no option rather than to depend on\\nthese software’ s outcomes.\\nFalse Positives\\nA high rate of false positives is another major disadvantage of vulnerability\\nassessment. A vulnerability scanner only detects threats that have been previously \\ndiscovered.\\nHence, unless you have updated your scanner tool for almost every weakness, which\\nis nigh impossible, it is not exactly capable of preventing any new attacks.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Briefly describe the methods of assessing the vulnerability of systems.\\nAns:\\nA vulnerability assessment is a process that involves identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing\\nvulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or applications. The goal of a vulnerability \\nassessment is to identify weaknesses in a system or network that could be exploited by an\\nattacker and to prioritize those vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and the\\nlikelihood of exploitation.\\nThere are several steps involved in a typical vulnerability assessment process:\\n1.\\nPlanning and scope definition:\\nThe first step in a\\nvulnerability assessment is to plan \\nthe scope of the assessment and define the goals and objectives. This includes \\ndetermining the scope of the assessment, the systems or networks that will be\\nincluded, and the type of vulnerabilities that will be looked for .\\n2.\\nData collection:\\nThe next step is to gather information\\nabout the systems or networks \\nbeing assessed. This may include running network scans, reviewing configuration \\nfiles, and analyzing system logs.\\n3.\\nVulnerability identification:\\nOnce the data has been\\ncollected, the vulnerability \\nassessment team will identify potential vulnerabilities in the systems or networks\\nbeing assessed. This may involve running automated tools or manually reviewing the \\ndata to identify potential weaknesses.\\n4.\\nVulnerability analysis:\\nOnce vulnerabilities have\\nbeen identified, they need to be \\nanalyzed to determine their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation. This may \\ninvolve consulting with subject matter experts, reviewing existing vulnerabilities\\ndatabases, or testing the vulnerabilities to see how they can be exploited.\\n5.\\nPrioritization:\\nThe final step in the vulnerability\\nassessment process is to prioritize \\nthe identified vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and the likelihood of\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This helps the or ganization determine which vulnerabilities should be \\naddressed first and allocate resources accordingly .\\n6.\\nRemediation:\\nOnce the vulnerabilities have been prioritized,\\nthe or ganization can \\nbegin the process of remediation, which involves implementing measures to mitigate\\nor eliminate the vulnerabilities. This may include applying patches, configuring \\nsystems to be more secure, or implementing additional security controls.\\n5. What is Penetration Testing? How is it differ ent fr om vulnerability assessment?\\nAns\\nPenetration testing (also known as \"pen testing\") is a simulated cyber attack on a computer\\nsystem, network, or web application to test its defenses and identify vulnerabilities that an\\nattacker could exploit. The goal of a pen test is to determine if an attacker could gain \\nunauthorized access to the system or steal sensitive data.\\nPenetration testing is dif ferent from a vulnerability assessment in a number of ways:\\n●\\nScope: Vulnerability assessments are generally broader in scope, looking at a wide \\nrange of vulnerabilities across the entire system. Pen tests, on the other hand, are\\nusually more focused, tar geting specific areas or vulnerabilities.\\n●\\nDepth: Vulnerability assessments are generally less in-depth than pen tests. They \\noften rely on automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities, while pen tests involve more\\nmanual testing and may involve attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.\\n●\\nApproval: Vulnerability assessments are usually done with the approval of the system \\nowner , while pen tests are often conducted without the knowledge or approval of the \\nsystem owner .\\n●\\nResults: Vulnerability assessments typically provide a list of vulnerabilities that need \\nto be addressed, while pen tests often include recommendations for how to remediate\\nthe vulnerabilities that were identified.\\nBoth vulnerability assessments and pen tests are important tools for identifying and\\naddressing vulnerabilities in systems. However , they serve dif ferent purposes and are \\nconducted in dif ferent ways.\\n⚡\\n6. Describe the Cyber  Kill Chain. State and explain various stages of a typical kill \\nchain.\\nThe Cyber Kill Chain is a methodology for understanding and defending against cyber\\nattacks. It was developed by Lockheed Martin and is used by or ganizations to identify and \\nmitigate threats at dif ferent stages of an attack.\\nThe Cyber Kill Chain consists of seven stages:\\n●\\nReconnaissance:\\nThis is the initial stage of an attack,\\nwhere the attacker gathers \\ninformation about the tar get.

The attack involves opening a TCP or\\nsimilar connection between the origin and the remote server . An Intrusion\\nDetection System (IDS) can easily detect an active banner .\\nb.\\nPassive Banner Capture: This method allows hackers and security analysts to\\nget the same information while avoiding disclosing the original connection.

Our base\\nYOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames\\nper second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO,\\nprocesses an astounding 155 frames per second while\\nstill achieving double the mAP of other real-time detec-\\ntors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO\\nmakes more localization errors but is far less likely to pre-\\ndict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO\\nlearns very general representations of objects. It outper-\\nforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-\\nCNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural im-\\nages to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-\\nArt Dataset.\\n1. Introduction\\nHumans glance at an image and instantly know what ob-\\njects are in the image, where they are, and how they in-\\nteract. The human visual system is fast and accurate, al-\\nlowing us to perform complex tasks like driving with little\\nconscious thought. Fast, accurate, algorithms for object de-\\ntection would allow computers to drive cars in any weather\\nwithout specialized sensors, enable assistive devices to con-\\nvey real-time scene information to human users, and unlock\\nthe potential for general purpose, responsive robotic sys-\\ntems.\\nCurrent detection systems repurpose classiﬁers to per-\\nform detection.

Processing images\\nwith YOLO is simple and straightforward.

Systems like deformable parts\\nmodels (DPM) use a sliding window approach where the\\nclassiﬁer is run at evenly spaced locations over the entire\\nimage [10].\\nMore recent approaches like R-CNN use region proposal\\nmethods to ﬁrst generate potential bounding boxes in an im-\\nage and then run a classiﬁer on these proposed boxes. After\\nclassiﬁcation, post-processing is used to reﬁne the bound-\\ning box, eliminate duplicate detections, and rescore the box\\nbased on other objects in the scene [13]. These complex\\npipelines are slow and hard to optimize because each indi-\\nvidual component must be trained separately.\\nWe reframe object detection as a single regression prob-\\nlem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordi-\\nnates and class probabilities. Using our system, you only\\nlook once (YOLO) at an image to predict what objects are\\npresent and where they are.\\nYOLO is refreshingly simple: see Figure 1. A sin-\\ngle convolutional network simultaneously predicts multi-\\nple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes.\\nYOLO trains on full images and directly optimizes detec-\\ntion performance.

Our base network runs at 45\\nframes per second with no batch processing on a Titan X\\nGPU and a fast version runs at more than 150 fps. This\\nmeans we can process streaming video in real-time with\\nless than 25 milliseconds of latency. Furthermore, YOLO\\nachieves more than twice the mean average precision of\\nother real-time systems. For a demo of our system run-\\nning in real-time on a webcam please see our (anonymous)\\nYouTube channel: https://goo.gl/bEs6Cj .\\nSecond, YOLO reasons globally about the image when\\nmaking predictions. Unlike sliding window and region\\nproposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image\\nduring training and test time so it encodes contextual in-\\nformation about classes as well as their appearance. Fast\\nR-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes background\\npatches in an image for objects because it can’t see the\\nlarger context. YOLO makes less than half the number of\\nbackground errors compared to Fast R-CNN.\\nThird, YOLO learns generalizable representations of ob-\\njects. When trained on natural images and tested on art-\\nwork, YOLO outperforms top detection methods like DPM\\nand R-CNN by a wide margin. Since YOLO is highly gen-\\neralizable it is less likely to break down when applied to\\nnew domains or unexpected input.\\nAll of our training and testing code is open source and\\navailable online at [removed for review]. A variety of pre-\\ntrained models are also available to download.\\n2. Uniﬁed Detection\\nWe unify the separate components of object detection\\ninto a single neural network. Our network uses features\\nfrom the entire image to predict each bounding box. It\\nalso predicts all bounding boxes for an image simultane-\\nously. This means our network reasons globally about the\\nfull image and all the objects in the image. The YOLO de-\\nsign enables end-to-end training and real-time speeds while\\nmaintaining high average precision.\\nOur system divides the input image into a S×Sgrid. If\\nthe center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is\\nresponsible for detecting that object.\\nEach grid cell predicts Bbounding boxes and conﬁdence\\nscores for those boxes. These conﬁdence scores reﬂect how\\nconﬁdent the model is that the box contains an object and\\nalso how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. For-\\nmally we deﬁne conﬁdence as Pr(Object )∗IOUtruth\\npred. If no\\nobject exists in that cell, the conﬁdence scores should be\\nzero. Otherwise we want the conﬁdence score to equal the\\nintersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box\\nand the ground truth.\\nEach bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x,y,w,h,\\nand conﬁdence. The (x,y)coordinates represent the center\\nof the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The width\\nand height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finallythe conﬁdence prediction represents the IOU between the\\npredicted box and any ground truth box.\\nEach grid cell also predicts Cconditional class proba-\\nbilities, Pr(Classi|Object ). These probabilities are condi-\\ntioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predict\\none set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the\\nnumber of boxes B.\\nAt test time we multiply the conditional class probabili-\\nties and the individual box conﬁdence predictions,\\nPr(Classi|Object )∗Pr(Object )∗IOUtruth\\npred= Pr( Classi)∗IOUtruth\\npred(1)\\nwhich gives us class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each\\nbox. These scores encode both the probability of that class\\nappearing in the box and how well the predicted box ﬁts the\\nobject.\\nFigure 2: The Model. Our system models detection as a re-\\ngression problem. It divides the image into an even grid and si-\\nmultaneously predicts bounding boxes, conﬁdence in those boxes,\\nand class probabilities.

Ren et\\nal. show that adding both convolutional and connected lay-\\ners to pretrained networks can improve performance [28].\\nFollowing their example, we add four convolutional lay-\\ners and two fully connected layers with randomly initialized\\nweights. Detection often requires ﬁne-grained visual infor-\\nmation so we increase the input resolution of the network\\nfrom 224×224to448×448.\\nOur ﬁnal layer predicts both class probabilities and\\nbounding box coordinates. We normalize the bounding box\\nwidth and height by the image width and height so that they\\nfall between 0 and 1. We parametrize the bounding box x\\nandycoordinates to be offsets of a particular grid cell loca-\\ntion so they are also bounded between 0 and 1.\\nWe use a linear activation function for the ﬁnal layer and\\nall other layers use the following leaky rectiﬁed linear acti-vation:\\nφ(x) ={\\nx, ifx>0\\n0.1x,otherwise(2)\\nWe optimize for sum-squared error in the output of our\\nmodel. We use sum-squared error because it is easy to op-\\ntimize, however it does not perfectly align with our goal of\\nmaximizing average precision. It weights localization er-\\nror equally with classiﬁcation error which may not be ideal.\\nAlso, in every image many grid cells do not contain any\\nobject. This pushes the “conﬁdence” scores of those cells\\ntowards zero, often overpowering the gradient from cells\\nthat do contain objects. This can lead to model instability,\\ncausing training to diverge early on.\\nTo remedy this, we increase the loss from bounding box\\ncoordinate predictions and decrease the loss from conﬁ-\\ndence predictions for boxes that don’t contain objects. We\\nuse two parameters, λcoordandλnoobjto accomplish this. We\\nsetλcoord= 5andλnoobj=.5.\\nSum-squared error also equally weights errors in large\\nboxes and small boxes. Our error metric should reﬂect that\\nsmall deviations in large boxes matter less than in small\\nboxes. To partially address this we predict the square root\\nof the bounding box width and height instead of the width\\nand height directly.\\nYOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell.\\nAt training time we only want one bounding box predictor\\nto be responsible for each object. We assign one predictor\\nto be “responsible” for predicting an object based on which\\nprediction has the highest current IOU with the ground\\ntruth. This leads to specialization between the bounding box\\npredictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certain\\nsizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overall\\nrecall.\\n3', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

When testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007\\ntest data. Throughout training we use a batch size of 64, a\\nmomentum of 0.9and a decay of 0.0005 .\\nOur learning rate schedule is as follows: For the ﬁrst\\nepochs we slowly raise the learning rate from 10−3to10−2.\\nIf we start at a high learning rate our model often diverges\\ndue to unstable gradients.

A dropout layer with rate = .5 after the ﬁrst\\nconnected layer prevents co-adaptation between layers [18].\\nFor data augmentation we introduce random scaling and\\ntranslations of up to 20% of the original image size. We\\nalso randomly adjust the exposure and saturation of the im-\\nage by up to a factor of 1.5in the HSV color space.\\n2.3. Inference\\nJust like in training, predicting detections for a test image\\nonly requires one network evaluation. On P ASCAL VOC the\\nnetwork predicts 98 bounding boxes per image and class\\nprobabilities for each box. YOLO is extremely fast at test\\ntime since it only requires a single network evaluation, un-\\nlike classiﬁer-based methods.\\nThe grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bound-\\ning box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an\\nobject falls in to and the network only predicts one box foreach object. However, some large objects or objects near\\nthe border of multiple cells can be well localized by multi-\\nple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to ﬁx these\\nmultiple detections. While not critical to performance as it\\nis for R-CNN or DPM, non-maximal suppression adds 2-\\n3% in mAP.\\n2.4. Limitations of YOLO\\nYOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding\\nbox predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes\\nand can only have one class. This spatial constraint lim-\\nits the number of nearby objects that our model can pre-\\ndict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in\\ngroups, such as ﬂocks of birds.\\nSince our model learns to predict bounding boxes from\\ndata, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual\\naspect ratios or conﬁgurations. Our model also uses rela-\\ntively coarse features for predicting bounding boxes since\\nour architecture has multiple downsampling layers from the\\ninput image.\\nFinally, while we train on a loss function that approxi-\\nmates detection performance, our loss function treats errors\\nthe same in small bounding boxes versus large bounding\\nboxes. A small error in a large box is generally benign but a\\nsmall error in a small box has a much greater effect on IOU.\\nOur main source of error is incorrect localizations.\\n3. Comparison to Other Detection Systems\\nObject detection is a core problem in computer vision.\\nDetection pipelines generally start by extracting a set of\\nrobust features from input images (Haar [25], SIFT [23],\\nHOG [4], convolutional features [6]). Then, classiﬁers\\n[35, 21, 13, 10] or localizers [1, 31] are used to identify\\nobjects in the feature space. These classiﬁers or localizers\\nare run either in sliding window fashion over the whole im-\\nage or on some subset of regions in the image [34, 15, 38].\\nWe compare the YOLO detection system to several top de-\\ntection frameworks, highlighting key similarities and differ-\\nences.\\nDeformable parts models. Deformable parts models\\n(DPM) use a sliding window approach to object detection\\n[10]. DPM uses a disjoint pipeline to extract static features,\\nclassify regions, predict bounding boxes for high scoring\\nregions, etc. Our system replaces all of these disparate parts\\nwith a single convolutional neural network. The network\\nperforms feature extraction, bounding box prediction, non-\\nmaximal suppression, and contextual reasoning all concur-\\nrently. Instead of static features, the network trains the fea-\\ntures in-line and optimizes them for the detection task. Our\\nuniﬁed architecture leads to a faster, more accurate model\\nthan DPM.\\nR-CNN. R-CNN and its variants use region proposals in-\\nstead of sliding windows to ﬁnd objects in images.

Each stage of this\\ncomplex pipeline must be precisely tuned independently\\nand the resulting system is very slow, taking more than 40\\nseconds per image at test time [14].\\nYOLO shares some similarities with R-CNN. Each grid\\ncell proposes a potential bounding boxes and scores those\\nboxes using convolutional features. However, our system\\nputs spatial constraints on the grid cell proposals which\\nhelps mitigate multiple detections of the same object. Our\\nsystem also proposes far fewer bounding boxes, only 98\\nper image compared to about 2000 from Selective Search.\\nFinally, our system combines these individual components\\ninto a single, jointly optimized model.\\nOther Fast Detectors Fast and Faster R-CNN focus on\\nspeeding up the R-CNN framework by sharing computa-\\ntion and using neural networks to propose regions instead\\nof Selective Search [14] [27]. While they offer speed and\\naccuracy improvements over R-CNN, both still fall short of\\nreal-time performance.\\nMany research efforts focus on speeding up the DPM\\npipeline [30] [37] [5]. They speed up HOG computation,\\nuse cascades, and push computation to GPUs. However,\\nonly 30Hz DPM actually runs in real-time.\\nInstead of trying to optimize individual components of\\na large detection pipeline, YOLO throws out the pipeline\\nentirely and is fast by design.\\nDetectors for single classes like faces or people can be\\nhighly optimized since they have to deal with much less\\nvariation [36]. YOLO is a general purpose detector that\\nlearns to detect a variety of objects simultaneously.\\nDeep MultiBox. Unlike R-CNN, Szegedy et al. train a\\nconvolutional neural network to predict regions of interest\\n[8] instead of using Selective Search. MultiBox can also\\nperform single object detection by replacing the conﬁdence\\nprediction with a single class prediction. However, Multi-\\nBox cannot perform general object detection and is still just\\na piece in a larger detection pipeline, requiring further im-\\nage patch classiﬁcation. Both YOLO and MultiBox use a\\nconvolutional network to predict bounding boxes in an im-\\nage but YOLO is a complete detection system.\\nOverFeat. Sermanet et al. train a convolutional neural\\nnetwork to perform localization and adapt that localizer to\\nperform detection [31]. OverFeat efﬁciently performs slid-\\ning window detection but it is still a disjoint system. Over-\\nFeat optimizes for localization, not detection performance.\\nLike DPM, the localizer only sees local information when\\nmaking a prediction. OverFeat cannot reason about global\\ncontext and thus requires signiﬁcant post-processing to pro-\\nduce coherent detections.\\nMultiGrasp. Our work is similar in design to work ongrasp detection by Redmon et al [26]. Our grid approach to\\nbounding box prediction is based on the MultiGrasp system\\nfor regression to grasps. However, grasp detection is a much\\nsimpler task than object detection. MultiGrasp only needs\\nto predict a single graspable region for an image containing\\none object. It doesn’t have to estimate the size, location or\\nboundaries of the object or predict it’s class only ﬁnd a re-\\ngion suitable for gripping. YOLO predicts both bounding\\nboxes and class probabilities for multiple objects of multi-\\nple classes in an image.\\n4. Experiments\\nFirst we compare YOLO with other real-time detection\\nsystems on P ASCAL VOC 2007. To understand the differ-\\nences between YOLO and R-CNN variants we explore the\\nerrors on VOC 2007 made by YOLO and Fast R-CNN, one\\nof the highest performing versions of R-CNN [14]. Based\\non the different error proﬁles we show that YOLO can be\\nused to rescore Fast R-CNN detections and reduce the er-\\nrors from background false positives, giving a signiﬁcant\\nperformance boost. We also present VOC 2012 results and\\ncompare mAP to current state-of-the-art methods. Finally,\\nwe show that YOLO generalizes to new domains better than\\nother detectors on two artwork datasets.\\n4.1. Comparison to Other Real-Time Systems\\nMany research efforts in object detection focus on mak-\\ning standard detection pipelines fast. [5] [37] [30] [14] [17]\\n[27] However, only Sadeghi et al. actually produce a detec-\\ntion system that runs in real-time (30 frames per second or\\nbetter). We compare YOLO to their GPU implementation of\\nDPM which runs either at 30Hz or 100Hz. While the other\\nefforts don’t reach the real-time milestone we also com-\\npare their relative mAP and speed to examine the accuracy-\\nperformance tradeoffs available in object detection systems.\\nFast YOLO is the fastest object detection method on\\nPASCAL ; as far as we know, it is the fastest extant object\\ndetector. With 52.7%mAP, it is more than twice as accu-\\nrate as prior work on real-time detection. YOLO pushes\\nmAP by an additional 10% while still maintaining real-time\\nperformance.\\nFastest DPM effectively speeds up DPM without sacri-\\nﬁcing much mAP but it still misses real-time performance\\nby a factor of 2. It also is limited by DPM’s relatively\\nlow accuracy on detection compared to neural network ap-\\nproaches.\\nR-CNN minus R replaces Selective Search with static\\nbounding box proposals. While it is much faster than R-\\nCNN, it still falls short of real-time and takes a signiﬁcant\\naccuracy hit from not having good proposals.\\nFast R-CNN speeds up the classiﬁcation stage of R-CNN\\nbut it still relies on selective search which can take around\\n2 seconds per image to generate bounding box proposals.\\n5', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Fast R-CNN + YOLO is the forth highest scoring method, with a 2.3% boost over Fast R-CNN.\\ning different versions of Fast R-CNN. Rather, it is specif-\\nically because YOLO makes different kinds of mistakes at\\ntest time that it is so effective at boosting Fast R-CNN’s\\nperformance.\\nUnfortunately, this combination doesn’t beneﬁt from the\\nspeed of YOLO since we run each model seperately and\\nthen combine the results. However, since YOLO is so fast\\nit doesn’t add any signiﬁcant computational time compared\\nto Fast R-CNN.\\n4.4. VOC 2012 Results\\nOn the VOC 2012 test set, YOLO scores 57.9% mAP.\\nThis is lower than the current state of the art, closer to\\nthe original R-CNN using VGG-16, see Table 3. Our sys-\\ntem struggles with small objects compared to its closest\\ncompetitors. On categories like bottle ,sheep , and\\ntv/monitor YOLO scores 8-10% lower than R-CNN or\\nFeature Edit. However, on other categories like cat and\\ntrain YOLO achieves higher performance.\\nOur combined Fast R-CNN + YOLO model is one of the\\nhighest performing detection methods. Fast R-CNN gets\\na 2.3% improvement from the combination with YOLO,\\nboosting it 5 spots up on the public leaderboard.\\n4.5. Generalizability\\nAcademic datasets for object detection draw the training\\nand testing data from the same distribution. In real-world\\napplications it is hard to predict all possible use cases and\\nthe test data can diverge from what the system has seen be-\\nfore [3]. We want our detector to learn robust representa-\\ntions of visual concepts so that they can generalize to new\\ndomains or unexpected input at test time.\\nWe compare YOLO to other detection systems on the\\nPicasso Dataset [12] and the People-Art Dataset [3], twodatasets for generalizing detection to artwork. Models are\\ntrained on subsets of the VOC data and then run on artwork\\nto detect people.\\nFigure 5 shows comparative performance between\\nYOLO and other detection methods. For reference, we give\\nVOC 2007 detection AP on person where all models are\\ntrained only on VOC 2007 data. On Picasso models are\\ntrained on VOC 2012 while on People-Art they are trained\\non VOC 2010.\\nYOLO outperforms other detection methods across the\\nboard. It has good performance on VOC 2007 and its AP\\ndegrades less than other methods when applied to artwork.\\nR-CNN has high AP on VOC 2007. However, R-CNN\\ndrops off considerably when applied to artwork. This sug-\\ngests that R-CNN is highly overﬁt to P ASCAL VOC. R-\\nCNN uses Selective Search for bounding box proposals\\nwhich is highly tuned for natural images. The classiﬁer step\\nin R-CNN only sees small regions and is dependant on get-\\nting good proposals from Selective Search.\\nDPM maintains its AP well when applied to artwork.\\nPrior work theorizes that DPM performs well because it has\\nstrong spatial models of the shape and layout of objects.\\nThough DPM doesn’t degrade as much as R-CNN, it also\\nstarts from a lower AP.\\nYOLO has high performance on VOC 2007 and it gen-\\neralizes well. Like DPM, YOLO models the size and shape\\nof objects. Since it looks at the whole image, it also models\\nrelationships between objects and where objects commonly\\nappear in scenes. Artwork and natural images are very dif-\\nferent on a pixel level but they are similar in terms of the\\nsize and shape of objects, thus YOLO can still predict good\\nbounding boxes and detections.\\n7', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Real-Time Detection In The Wild\\nYOLO is a fast, accurate object detector, making it ideal\\nfor computer vision applications. We connect YOLO to a\\nwebcam and verify that it maintains real-time performance,\\nincluding the time to fetch images from the camera and dis-\\nplay the detections.\\nThe resulting system is interactive and engaging. While\\nYOLO processes images individually, when attached to a\\nwebcam it functions like a tracking system, detecting ob-\\njects as they move around and change in appearance. A\\ndemo of the system can be found on our YouTube channel:\\nhttps://goo.gl/bEs6Cj .6. Conclusion\\nWe introduce YOLO, a uniﬁed model for object detec-\\ntion. Our model is simple to construct and can be trained\\ndirectly on full images. Unlike classiﬁer-based approaches,\\nYOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds\\nto detection performance and the entire model is trained\\njointly.\\nFast YOLO is the fastest general-purpose object detec-\\ntor in the literature and YOLO pushes the state-of-the-art in\\nreal-time object detection. YOLO also generalizes well to\\nnew domains making it ideal for applications that rely on\\nfast, robust object detection.\\n8', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
